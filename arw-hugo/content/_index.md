## About me:
I am a recent PhD graduate from the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
I studied control theory under my coadvisors [Necmiye Ozay](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~necmiye/)
and [Stephane Lafortune](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~stephane). I graduated from the University of Tennessee,
Knoxville in May 2018 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and double major in Mathematics.

## My research:

I am interested in security and safety of cyberphysical systems within the frameworks of hybrid systems and discrete event systems.
I am currently working on abstraction-based control, controlled invariant set computation, and opacity verification and enforcement.
